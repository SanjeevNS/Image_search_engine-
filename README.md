# Image_search_engine-

This is a colab file which contains a image search engine code using deep learning.
this image search engine uses colour and shape as a metrics and retrive images relevent to te query image 
This search engine was built using pretrained VGG19 model and knn model to find similar images

 Follow these steps to run the code

 STEP1 -> import the necessary packages
 
 STEP2 -> next import the zip file
 
 STEP3 -> after importing the zip file , unzip it
 
 STEP4 -> Set path to images folder
 
 STEP5 -> Load VGG19 model
 
 STEP6 -> Get list of image file names
 
 STEP7 -> Preprocess images and extract features using VGG19
 
 STEP8 -> Convert features to numpy array
 
 STEP9 -> Fit k-nearest neighbors model
 
 STEP10 -> Get query image
 
 STEP11 -> Find similar images using knn model

 STEP12 -> Plot similar images
